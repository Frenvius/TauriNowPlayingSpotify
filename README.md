# Spotify Now Playing to Windows Live Messenger

This project allows you to send "now playing" information from Spotify to Windows Live Messenger. This can be useful if you are using Windows Live Messenger nowaday with [escargot.chat](https://escargot.chat/) and you want to show your friends what you are listening to.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Live Messenger on your machine.

2. Run the development server: `npm run tauri dev`.

   This should start the Next.js development server.

3. Click the "Send Now Playing" button.

   This should send the "now playing" information to Windows Live Messenger.

**TODO:** Add the Spotify API integration so that the "now playing" information is retrieved automatically.
